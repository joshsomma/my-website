I"H<p>When my Dad moved house several years back, he gave me a couple of old VHS tapes of mine that had been stored in the basement. I <em>finally</em> took the time to watch them (itâ€™s not easy finding VHS players these days!) and found this old clip of me ripping it up on Route 3 wave on the Black River in Watertown, NY.</p>
