I"Ï<p>â€¦ and it was to see an NFL game of all things. Lucked upon a free ticket to see Bears vs Raiders which I believe was the first NFL game to be played in the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium. The new stadium really is impressive with great atmosphere inside. Canâ€™t wait to get to see Spurs play which will hopefully happen this season.</p>

<p>As I was approaching the stadium with my companion Rob, we were discussing how modern the stadium was and how it had the longest bar in Europe. I said I would be really impressed if we could walk in right up to the bar and order a beer with no wait. Sure enough, thatâ€™s exactly what we were able to do. Shame that Spurâ€™s put the price up an extra Â£1.50 per pint for the NFL fans. Boo Spurs!</p>

<p>Anyway, hereâ€™s a view from our seats in the south stand of the pre-gameâ€¦</p>
