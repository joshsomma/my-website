I"<p>Didn’t curate a list of good links this week so posting about my 3D printing side project. Here’s a bit of information about my Anet A8 3D printer. If you’ve never heard of the Anet A8, its a cheap but capable 3D printer you can buy from sites like <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/sale/anet-a8/" target="_blank">GearBest</a>. I was given one intact but non-functioning by a guy from work. Trying to get it to work has meant <em>lots</em> of time on youtube, stackoverflow and reddit. It’s a bit maddening really.</p>
